Allows you to choose how the projects are sorted in **List Projects** commands. You can choose:

--

* **Saved**: The order that you saved the projects
* **Name**: The name that you typed for the project
* **Path**: The full path of the project

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:
